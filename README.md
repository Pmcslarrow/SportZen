# SportZen

SportZen is a React and Firebase application designed to enhance communication between the coaching staff and players of Willamette Men's Basketball. The core concept behind SportZen is to empower players to submit daily survey data, providing insights into their mental, physical, and sleep quality, as well as self-assessments of their performance during practice or games.

## Key Features

- **Daily Surveys**: Players can easily submit daily surveys to track their well-being and performance. This data forms the foundation for deeper insights and improvements. The survey has been set up in a way to limit users to one survey per day so that data isn't scewed incorrectly.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: SportZen provides coaches and players with an intuitive analytics dashboard. Here, you can explore data-driven insights into team performance, identifying what's working well and areas that require attention.

- **Correlation Analysis**: Dive deeper into the data to identify correlations and trends. Discover how mental, physical, or sleep quality factors relate to on-court performance, helping tailor training and recovery strategies.

## Future Enhancements

We have exciting plans for the future of SportZen, including:

- **Motivation Button**: An upcoming feature will allow players to interact with a motivation button. Use it to inspire and support each other, fostering team camaraderie and motivation.

- **Direct Chat and Shared Team Calendar**: We plan to implement a direct chat area and a shared team calendar. Coaches and players can collaborate and stay aligned by utilizing these features. The shared team calendar will be fully editable by the coaching staff, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding practice schedules, games, and events.
